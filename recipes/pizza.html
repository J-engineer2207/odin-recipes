    <h6>Delicious Pizza</h6>

    <p>Pizza is a beloved comfort food that's both delicious and customizable, making it the perfect meal for any occasion. Whether you're in the mood for a classic Margherita, a veggie-packed delight, or a meat lover's feast, pizza allows you to get creative with toppings while still keeping things simple. 
        It's easy to prepare, even in a college kitchen, and you can make it with store-bought dough or from scratch if you're up for it. Plus, pizza can be as quick as a 15-minute bake or a slow-cooked masterpiece, depending on your time and effort.
    </p>

    <p>Making pizza at home also gives you control over the ingredients, allowing you to choose fresher, healthier options compared to takeout. You can top your pizza with a variety of vegetables, cheeses, and proteins to suit your taste, and even make personal-sized pizzas for yourself or a group.
        With minimal ingredients—dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings—you can create a pizza that's both satisfying and easy to customize to your cravings, making it the ultimate college-friendly meal that's perfect for dinner or sharing with friends.

    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (or marinara sauce)</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons olive oil (for brushing the crust)</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)
            Dried oregano or basil (optional, for seasoning)</li>
            
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it heats up.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer it to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Add Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        <li>Arrange your chosen toppings evenly over the cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle dried oregano or basil over the top for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the exposed crust with olive oil to ensure a golden and crispy finish.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a minute, then slice and serve hot.</li>
        <li>.</li>
